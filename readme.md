# FikaSearch Exercise

The objective of this exercise is to fork this repository and create a `react-native` app called 'FikaSearch'. This app will comprise of a listing page of films and the names of their genres. The page should also allow the user to search the films by typing into a text field.

We expect you to have an understandable structure, clean code, and to be able to describe your next steps in any aspects of the challenge you arent able to complete in a few of hours.

## Technical details

### API

You will need to use the following URLs to fetch the films and genres from `the movie db` API:

movies - [https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?api_key=d432b933ecc6d5642d8d2befbc40c7ac&language=en-US&page=1&include_adult=false](https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?api_key=d432b933ecc6d5642d8d2befbc40c7ac&language=en-US&page=1&include_adult=false)

movies search - [https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=d432b933ecc6d5642d8d2befbc40c7ac&language=en-US&page=1&include_adult=false&query=searchterm](https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=d432b933ecc6d5642d8d2befbc40c7ac&language=en-US&page=1&include_adult=false&query=shrek)

genres - [https://api.themoviedb.org/3/genre/movie/list?api_key=d432b933ecc6d5642d8d2befbc40c7ac&language=en-US](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-movie-list)

#### Images

The API will provide part of the image url via the `poster_path` field of each film. It must be combined with the base image path `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/`

**Have fun!**


### Notes

I've moved the API key into a `.env` file, and included a `.env.sample`. The key is shown above, but in case it was secret, it shouldn't be in the repo. You will need to copy `.env.sample` => `.env` and add the API key.

Things to do:
- Add Cypress for F/E resting
- Add more component tests
- Handle films with no movie poster with placeholder
- Eject from CreateReactApp and tidy up, or lift and shift to be without CRA.
- Run eslint / prettier on commit with commit hooks
